\chapter{Introduction}

This report covers the \exploitname{} vulnerabilities found in \product{} by \Lyrebirds.
The purpose of the report is to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities, such that manufactures, ISPs, businesses and end users are aware of the danger associated with the use of \product.

The exploit is explained from the inside out, starting with the architecture of the \product.
Then the attack on the spectrum analyzer is presented, which is the central part of gaining complete control over the cable modem.
Afterwards, it is explained how to enable remote access to the spectrum analyzer exploit. 
Without external access, the spectrum analyzer would only be exploitable on the local network.

In the appendices is a list of the modems confirmed as vulnerable, exploitation of a specific cable modem and guides and help on exploring the vulnerabilities and expanding them to other modems.

% The current response from Broadcom states that since they are phasing out their own firmware they have no firmware that fixes the exploit. 
% However Lyrebirds.dk have worked with several Danish ISPs and found ways of fixing the issue, which should be available for any ISP with affected hardware.
% Some of the contacted ISPs are currently in the process of rolling out fixed versions.
